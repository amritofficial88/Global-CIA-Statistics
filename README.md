## Project Overview
This project explores global cybersecurity readiness, exposure, and digital development using four key indexes: the Cybersecurity Exposure Index (CEI), Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), National Cyber Security Index (NCSI), and Digital Development Level (DDL). The dataset covers 193 countries and regions, enabling comparative analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling.


## Dataset Description
The dataset includes four indicators which illustrate the current cybersecurity situation around the world:
- **Cybersecurity Exposure Index (CEI)**: Defines the level of exposure to cybercrime by country from 0 to 1; the higher the score, the higher the exposure. Last updated in 2020.
- **Global Cyber Security Index (GCI)**: Measures the commitment of countries to cybersecurity at a global level to raise awareness of the importance and different dimensions of the issue. Last updated in 2021.
- **National Cyber Security Index (NCSI)**: Measures a country's readiness to address cyber threats and manage cyber incidents. Last updated in January 2023.
- **Digital Development Level (DDL)**: Defines the average percentage the country received from the maximum value of both indices. Last updated in January 2023.


## Objectives
- **Comparative Analysis**: Identify top and bottom performers in each index and regional trends.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore relationships between CEI, GCI, NCSI, and DDL.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Create maps and heatmaps to visualize cybersecurity exposure and readiness.
- **Strategic Insights**: Provide policy implications and investment opportunities based on the analysis.


## Tools Used
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and cleaning.
- **Excel/Power BI**: For visualization and reporting.
